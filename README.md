# Computer Vision API (cv_api)

Welcome to the Computer Vision API (cv_api) project, a comprehensive Python library designed for advanced image and video processing tasks.

## Overview

The `cv_api` project is structured to facilitate the development and integration of computer vision features into various applications. It comprises submodules for image detection and video processing, allowing for object detection in images and generative video creation, among other capabilities.

## Structure

- **Image Detection**: This submodule contains algorithms and models that focus on detecting objects within static images.
- **Video Processing**: Includes models for generating and manipulating video data, specifically using diffusion-based generative models.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Implement object detection models that can locate and identify objects within images.
- **Video Diffusion**: Extend the `VideoDiffusionModelBase` class to generate video frames based on diffusion processes.

## Installation

You can install `cv_api` by cloning this repository and setting it up with your Python environment:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd cv_api
pip install -e .
```
